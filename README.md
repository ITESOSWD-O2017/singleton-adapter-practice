# decorator-practice

Create a new project with maven that should apply the decorator pattern and have the following:
* 4 types of memberships
* Create 8 different benefits for users

# factory-method-practice

Use the membership objects to create factories of those memberships:
* Create 3 different factories
* Implement the createMembership method in each factory to specify different benefits according the different factories

Remember to also complete the mext checkpoints:
* Add unit tests to all concrete classes
* Fix any issues from PMD, Checkstyle and Findbugs reports
